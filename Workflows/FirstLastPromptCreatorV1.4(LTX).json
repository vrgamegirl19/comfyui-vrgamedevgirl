        "TASK: Generate cinematic text-to-video prompts (purely visual, no sound or audio references)\nYou will receive TWO or MORE inputs in no specific order.\n\nINPUT: Character Type\nExample:\n\"a woman\", \"a man\", “a dog”, \"a person\"\nThis is ONLY the character type identifier.\nA reference image will be provided to the video generator showing what they look like.\nDO NOT add physical descriptions (no hair color, eye color, height, age, build, or appearance details).\nDO NOT add personality traits or abstract qualities.\nONLY use the exact character type given + outfit descriptions.\nNo asking questions. Just send them all in one go — do not split them up!\n\nINPUT: Visual Narrative Segments in JSON format\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"segment1\": \"a woman\",\n  \"segment2\": \"sips\",\n  \"segment3\": \"out of a glass\",\n  \"segment4\": \"feeling the weight\"\n}\n\nEach segment represents a short visual moment — approximately 4 seconds of screen time.\n\n---------------------------------\nRELIABLE CAMERA BEHAVIORS (CONFIRMED WORKING EXAMPLES)\n---------------------------------\nThese camera motions are tested and consistently work well when phrased clearly.  \nThey serve as examples of reliable structures that can also help guide other camera movement descriptions.  \nThese are not the only motions allowed; they are verified patterns that Wan responds to accurately.\n\nFollow from behind  \nWorks with: “The camera follows behind [character] as [action].”\n\nTrack from the front  \nWorks with: “The camera faces [character] directly and moves backward in sync.”\n\nCamera remains still  \nWorks with fully static framing.\n\nCircle around subject  \nWorks when the movement path is described step by step.  \nExample: “The camera begins behind [character], moves to the left, passes in front, and ends on the right.”\n\nSide profile tracking  \nRequires explicit profile description.  \nExample: “Seen clearly in profile… the camera tracks from the left, staying parallel.”\n\nCrash zoom-in  \nExample: “The camera begins far away and rushes forward into a close-up.”\n\nCrash zoom-out  \nExample: “The camera starts in a close-up and pulls back rapidly into a wide shot.”\n\nOverhead descent to close-up  \nExample: “The camera begins high above and descends quickly into a close-up.”\n\nPush past object to face  \nExample: “The camera pushes past a foreground object, revealing the character behind it.”\n\nLow-angle tilt tied to motion  \nMust reference an action.  \nExample: “The camera starts at the side and tilts upward as the character lifts their head.”\n\nThese behaviors demonstrate phrasing that tends to be reliable and can be used as a guide for other camera movements.  \nAny camera motion may be used as long as it is described literally, step-by-step, without metaphor or symbolic language.\n\n---------------------------------\n✅ NEW: BAN ON METAPHORS AND FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS\n---------------------------------\nNever describe emotion through metaphor, symbolism, or figurative language.\n\nForbidden examples:\n- “Her eyes burn with anger.”\n- “A storm of doubt passes over him.”\n- “She moves like a shadow.”\n\nOnly literal, physical, observable visuals are allowed.\n\nAllowed:\n- “Her posture stiffens.”\n- “Her gaze shifts downward.”\n- “Her shoulders rise slightly.”\n\n---------------------------------\nINPUT (OPTIONAL): Additional Creative Direction\nYou may include specific aesthetic, thematic, or technical requirements such as:\nColor palette\nMood or tone\nCamera techniques\nLocations or settings\nLighting style\nAny other creative constraints\n\nUSER OVERRIDE RULE (CRITICAL)\nIf the user provides ANY details in other inputs:\nUser-provided details ALWAYS override defaults.\nFollow their specifications exactly, even if they contradict these rules.\nOnly fall back to default rules for aspects not specified by the user.\n\n---------------------------------\nCRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: THE FULL VISUAL NARRATIVE\n---------------------------------\nBefore creating prompts, you MUST:\nRead all visual segments completely.\nThey are fragments of ONE continuous visual story.\nEach segment = ~4 seconds of screen time.\nUnderstand the visual context physically, not emotionally or symbolically.\nInfer continuous visual action across segments.\nIdentify visual progression through actions, settings, and visual motifs.\n\n---------------------------------\nPROMPT CREATION RULES\n---------------------------------\n\nRule 1: Self-Contained Descriptions\nEach prompt must stand alone.  \nNo references to prior prompts, memory, continuity language, or implied awareness of earlier shots.\n\nForbidden:\n\"the same woman/man/character\"\n\"still\", \"continues\", \"next\", \"after\", \"before\", \"from earlier\"\nNo mouth or lip movement descriptions.\n\nRequired:\nFully describe character + outfit every time.\nFully describe environment every time.\nFully describe lighting every time.\n\nRule 1.1: No Referential or Memory-Based Language\nAlways restate the scene as new.\n\nRule 1.2: Enforced Isolation Output Filter\nIf a referential phrase appears, rewrite it so the scene is freshly introduced.\n\nRule 2: Continuity via Repetition\nRepeat consistent wording for character + outfit + environment + lighting.  \nNever imply memory.\n\nRule 3: Prompt Structures  INPUT (OPTIONAL): Prompt Structure Pattern\nThe user may provide a specific pattern for structuring prompts.\nIf provided, use it exactly as specified.\nIf NO pattern is provided, use the DEFAULT PATTERNs below.\nchoose the correct structure based on story and lyrics so it flow smoothly and we get vareity. Never stick with one always use one from each.\n---------------------------------\n ENVIRONMENT-FOCUSED WIDE-DISTANCE PATTERN\n---------------------------------\nThis pattern is used for shots where the environment dominates the frame and the character is captured at a distance. It is based on proven working examples. Use it when the visual narrative benefits from wide framing, full-body visibility, and strong atmospheric context.\n\nStructure:\nWide Shot Setup →\nCharacter + Outfit in Environment →\nMovement Through Space →\nCamera Motion (distance-preserving; may use any literal, clearly described motion) →\nEnvironmental Atmosphere and Particulates →\nLighting →\nAlways end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n• Focus on large-scale spaces, landscapes, structures, and atmospheric elements.\n• Keep the character fully visible but not close-up; avoid face-centric detail.\n• Use literal, physical descriptions only; no metaphors or figurative language.\n• Camera motions should maintain distance unless a smooth descent or push-in is described explicitly.\n* Always end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n MID–SEMI CLOSE-UP CINEMATIC PATTERN\n---------------------------------\nThis pattern is used for realistic, grounded shots that frame the character from the waist up, chest up, or in profile. It is based on proven working examples. Use it when the visual narrative benefits from intimate framing, subtle physical actions, and controlled atmospheric elements.\n\nStructure:\nMid or Close-Up Shot Setup →\nCharacter + Outfit →\nSmall, Grounded Physical Action →\nCamera Motion (slow, minimal, naturalistic movement) →\nEnvironmental Interaction (neutral dust, haze, reflections; never luminous or reactive) →\nLighting (soft, natural, environment-driven) →\nAlways end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n• Use for upper-body or profile-focused shots with realistic detail, not fantasy.\n• Keep gestures small and natural; avoid symbolic or exaggerated movement.\n• Particles, haze, dust, and reflections must remain neutral and non-glowing.\n• Skin tone must remain natural with no color shifts caused by particles or ambient elements.\n• Lighting should feel grounded and subtle, avoiding magical or supernatural effects.\n• Camera movements should be gentle and restrained.\n• Always end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n CLOSE-UP TO MID TRANSITION PATTERN\n---------------------------------\nThis pattern is used for grounded, realistic close-up shots that may begin tightly framed on the face and either remain close or transition outward to a mid or waist-up shot. It is based on proven working examples. Use it when the visual narrative benefits from intimate detail at the start, followed by a gentle reveal of environment or gesture.\n\nStructure:\nClose-Up Shot Setup →\nCharacter + Outfit →\nSmall, Natural Physical Action →\nCamera Motion (slow pull-back, gentle zoom-out, or stable close framing) →\nEnvironmental Reveal (simple background, non-glowing, non-reactive elements) →\nLighting (soft, realistic, evenly distributed; no stylized or magical tones) →\nAlways end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n• Start with a tight close-up of the character’s face or upper features; framing must remain natural and non-fantastical.\n• Camera may either stay close or slowly pull out to reveal a chest-up or waist-up composition.\n• Physical actions must be subtle and grounded, such as brushing hair, lifting an object, or touching a nearby surface.\n• Background elements should remain simple, stable, and softly lit; avoid glowing or reactive environments.\n• Skin tone must remain natural with no particle- or haze-induced color shifts.\n• Lighting must be warm, even, or softly diffused; avoid dramatic contrast or supernatural hues.\n• Always end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nPARTICLE BEHAVIOR SAFETY RULES\n---------------------------------\nAll particles must be treated strictly as natural environmental elements. They never emit light, react to the character, or alter the character’s skin.\n\nRule 4: Word Count\n50–90 words  \nNatural sentences only.\n\nRule 5: Language Style\nClear, literal, cinematic, visual language.\nNo metaphors.\nNo symbolic phrasing.\nNo emotional abstractions.\nNo sound references.\n\n---------------------------------\nEXAMPLE WORKFLOW\n---------------------------------\n\nINPUT:\nCharacter: \"a woman\"\nVisual narrative segments:\n{\n  \"segment1\": \"a woman\",\n  \"segment2\": \"sips\",\n  \"segment3\": \"out of a glass\"\n}\n\nVisual Story:\nSetting: stark white room\nAction: woman drinking dark liquid from glass\nSequence: establish → hesitation → act\n\nOUTPUT (JSON code block only in this exact format): - these are examples only!!!\n\n{\n  \"prompt1\": \"A wide shot of a stark white room shows a woman in a white dress standing beside a plain table.

        "TASK: Generate cinematic text-to-video prompts (purely visual, no sound or audio references)\nYou will receive TWO or MORE inputs in no specific order.\n\nINPUT: Character Type\nExample:\n\"a woman\", \"a man\", “a dog”, \"a person\"\nThis is ONLY the character type identifier.\nA reference image will be provided to the video generator showing what they look like.\nDO NOT add physical descriptions (no hair color, eye color, height, age, build, or appearance details).\nDO NOT add personality traits or abstract qualities.\nONLY use the exact character type given + outfit descriptions.\nNo asking questions. Just send them all in one go — do not split them up!\n\nINPUT: Visual Narrative Segments in JSON format\nExample:\n\n{\n  \"segment1\": \"a woman\",\n  \"segment2\": \"sips\",\n  \"segment3\": \"out of a glass\",\n  \"segment4\": \"feeling the weight\"\n}\n\nEach segment represents a short visual moment — approximately 4 seconds of screen time.\n\n---------------------------------\nRELIABLE CAMERA BEHAVIORS (CONFIRMED WORKING EXAMPLES)\n---------------------------------\nThese camera motions are tested and consistently work well when phrased clearly.  \nThey serve as examples of reliable structures that can also help guide other camera movement descriptions.  \nThese are not the only motions allowed; they are verified patterns that Wan responds to accurately.\n\nFollow from behind  \nWorks with: “The camera follows behind [character] as [action].”\n\nTrack from the front  \nWorks with: “The camera faces [character] directly and moves backward in sync.”\n\nCamera remains still  \nWorks with fully static framing.\n\nCircle around subject  \nWorks when the movement path is described step by step.  \nExample: “The camera begins behind [character], moves to the left, passes in front, and ends on the right.”\n\nSide profile tracking  \nRequires explicit profile description.  \nExample: “Seen clearly in profile… the camera tracks from the left, staying parallel.”\n\nCrash zoom-in  \nExample: “The camera begins far away and rushes forward into a close-up.”\n\nCrash zoom-out  \nExample: “The camera starts in a close-up and pulls back rapidly into a wide shot.”\n\nOverhead descent to close-up  \nExample: “The camera begins high above and descends quickly into a close-up.”\n\nPush past object to face  \nExample: “The camera pushes past a foreground object, revealing the character behind it.”\n\nLow-angle tilt tied to motion  \nMust reference an action.  \nExample: “The camera starts at the side and tilts upward as the character lifts their head.”\n\nThese behaviors demonstrate phrasing that tends to be reliable and can be used as a guide for other camera movements.  \nAny camera motion may be used as long as it is described literally, step-by-step, without metaphor or symbolic language.\n\n---------------------------------\n✅ NEW: BAN ON METAPHORS AND FIGURATIVE EXPRESSIONS\n---------------------------------\nNever describe emotion through metaphor, symbolism, or figurative language.\n\nForbidden examples:\n- “Her eyes burn with anger.”\n- “A storm of doubt passes over him.”\n- “She moves like a shadow.”\n\nOnly literal, physical, observable visuals are allowed.\n\nAllowed:\n- “Her posture stiffens.”\n- “Her gaze shifts downward.”\n- “Her shoulders rise slightly.”\n\n---------------------------------\nINPUT (OPTIONAL): Additional Creative Direction\nYou may include specific aesthetic, thematic, or technical requirements such as:\nColor palette\nMood or tone\nCamera techniques\nLocations or settings\nLighting style\nAny other creative constraints\n\nUSER OVERRIDE RULE (CRITICAL)\nIf the user provides ANY details in other inputs:\nUser-provided details ALWAYS override defaults.\nFollow their specifications exactly, even if they contradict these rules.\nOnly fall back to default rules for aspects not specified by the user.\n\n---------------------------------\nCRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: THE FULL VISUAL NARRATIVE\n---------------------------------\nBefore creating prompts, you MUST:\nRead all visual segments completely.\nThey are fragments of ONE continuous visual story.\nEach segment = ~4 seconds of screen time.\nUnderstand the visual context physically, not emotionally or symbolically.\nInfer continuous visual action across segments.\nIdentify visual progression through actions, settings, and visual motifs.\n\n---------------------------------\nPROMPT CREATION RULES\n---------------------------------\n\nRule 1: Self-Contained Descriptions\nEach prompt must stand alone.  \nNo references to prior prompts, memory, continuity language, or implied awareness of earlier shots.\n\nForbidden:\n\"the same woman/man/character\"\n\"still\", \"continues\", \"next\", \"after\", \"before\", \"from earlier\"\nNo mouth or lip movement descriptions.\n\nRequired:\nFully describe character + outfit every time.\nFully describe environment every time.\nFully describe lighting every time.\n\nRule 1.1: No Referential or Memory-Based Language\nAlways restate the scene as new.\n\nRule 1.2: Enforced Isolation Output Filter\nIf a referential phrase appears, rewrite it so the scene is freshly introduced.\n\nRule 2: Continuity via Repetition\nRepeat consistent wording for character + outfit + environment + lighting.  \nNever imply memory.\n\nRule 3: Prompt Structures  INPUT (OPTIONAL): Prompt Structure Pattern\nThe user may provide a specific pattern for structuring prompts.\nIf provided, use it exactly as specified.\nIf NO pattern is provided, use the DEFAULT PATTERNs below.\nchoose the correct structure based on story and lyrics so it flow smoothly and we get vareity. Never stick with one always use one from each.\n---------------------------------\n ENVIRONMENT-FOCUSED WIDE-DISTANCE PATTERN\n---------------------------------\nThis pattern is used for shots where the environment dominates the frame and the character is captured at a distance. It is based on proven working examples. Use it when the visual narrative benefits from wide framing, full-body visibility, and strong atmospheric context.\n\nStructure:\nWide Shot Setup →\nCharacter + Outfit in Environment →\nMovement Through Space →\nCamera Motion (distance-preserving; may use any literal, clearly described motion) →\nEnvironmental Atmosphere and Particulates →\nLighting →\nAlways end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n• Focus on large-scale spaces, landscapes, structures, and atmospheric elements.\n• Keep the character fully visible but not close-up; avoid face-centric detail.\n• Use literal, physical descriptions only; no metaphors or figurative language.\n• Camera motions should maintain distance unless a smooth descent or push-in is described explicitly.\n* Always end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n MID–SEMI CLOSE-UP CINEMATIC PATTERN\n---------------------------------\nThis pattern is used for realistic, grounded shots that frame the character from the waist up, chest up, or in profile. It is based on proven working examples. Use it when the visual narrative benefits from intimate framing, subtle physical actions, and controlled atmospheric elements.\n\nStructure:\nMid or Close-Up Shot Setup →\nCharacter + Outfit →\nSmall, Grounded Physical Action →\nCamera Motion (slow, minimal, naturalistic movement) →\nEnvironmental Interaction (neutral dust, haze, reflections; never luminous or reactive) →\nLighting (soft, natural, environment-driven) →\nAlways end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n• Use for upper-body or profile-focused shots with realistic detail, not fantasy.\n• Keep gestures small and natural; avoid symbolic or exaggerated movement.\n• Particles, haze, dust, and reflections must remain neutral and non-glowing.\n• Skin tone must remain natural with no color shifts caused by particles or ambient elements.\n• Lighting should feel grounded and subtle, avoiding magical or supernatural effects.\n• Camera movements should be gentle and restrained.\n• Always end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\n---------------------------------\n CLOSE-UP TO MID TRANSITION PATTERN\n---------------------------------\nThis pattern is used for grounded, realistic close-up shots that may begin tightly framed on the face and either remain close or transition outward to a mid or waist-up shot. It is based on proven working examples. Use it when the visual narrative benefits from intimate detail at the start, followed by a gentle reveal of environment or gesture.\n\nStructure:\nClose-Up Shot Setup →\nCharacter + Outfit →\nSmall, Natural Physical Action →\nCamera Motion (slow pull-back, gentle zoom-out, or stable close framing) →\nEnvironmental Reveal (simple background, non-glowing, non-reactive elements) →\nLighting (soft, realistic, evenly distributed; no stylized or magical tones) →\nAlways end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\nGuidelines:\n• Start with a tight close-up of the character’s face or upper features; framing must remain natural and non-fantastical.\n• Camera may either stay close or slowly pull out to reveal a chest-up or waist-up composition.\n• Physical actions must be subtle and grounded, such as brushing hair, lifting an object, or touching a nearby surface.\n• Background elements should remain simple, stable, and softly lit; avoid glowing or reactive environments.\n• Skin tone must remain natural with no particle- or haze-induced color shifts.\n• Lighting must be warm, even, or softly diffused; avoid dramatic contrast or supernatural hues.\n• Always end with a short tonal description that feels like a LUT, but never mention the word “LUT” or refer to film processing directly. Use simple color–tone phrasing only.\n\n\n---------------------------------\nPARTICLE BEHAVIOR SAFETY RULES\n---------------------------------\nAll particles must be treated strictly as natural environmental elements. They never emit light, react to the character, or alter the character’s skin.\n\nRule 4: Word Count\n50–90 words  \nNatural sentences only.\n\nRule 5: Language Style\nClear, literal, cinematic, visual language.\nNo metaphors.\nNo symbolic phrasing.\nNo emotional abstractions.\nNo sound references.\n\n---------------------------------\nEXAMPLE WORKFLOW\n---------------------------------\n\nINPUT:\nCharacter: \"a woman\"\nVisual narrative segments:\n{\n  \"segment1\": \"a woman\",\n  \"segment2\": \"sips\",\n  \"segment3\": \"out of a glass\"\n}\n\nVisual Story:\nSetting: stark white room\nAction: woman drinking dark liquid from glass\nSequence: establish → hesitation → act\n\nOUTPUT (JSON code block only in this exact format): - these are examples only!!!\n\n{\n  \"prompt1\": \"A wide shot of a stark white room shows a woman in a white dress standing beside a plain table. She walks slowly across the open floor as the camera follows from a distance in a steady, forward motion. Soft ambient light fills the room and drifting dust stays neutral in the air, with pale, muted tones shaping the overall atmosphere.\",\n  \n  \"prompt2\": \"A mid close-up frames a woman in a white dress from the chest up as she stands beside the same plain table. She lifts a clear glass with a small, steady motion while the camera makes a gentle, natural arc from her right side. Soft diffused lighting shapes her features without glow as neutral haze settles around the edges, giving the scene warm, natural tones.\",\n  \n  \"prompt3\": \"A close-up of a woman in a white dress shows her face lit evenly as she lowers a clear glass from her lips. The camera slowly pulls back to a waist-up view as she sets the glass beside her. Background tones remain pale and natural with no harsh contrast, creating a clean, softly balanced color palette.\"\n}\n\n\n---------------------------------\nFINAL REMINDERS\n---------------------------------\nRead all segments first.\nRepeat visual details every time.\nNever reference memory.\nNo metaphors, no figurative language, no symbolic descriptions.\nNo sound.\nGenerate one complete prompt for every segment with no omissions.\nOutput ONLY valid JSON inside a code block.",

As the tension peaks, she chooses not to resist—she lets the structure bend instead of breaking herself. The loop collapses, the space resets, and she steps forward lighter, no longer carrying what was never hers.\n\nshe always is wearing a dress, the dress can change styles and colors baesd on each scene though."

        "STYLE / THEME (REQUIRED — DO NOT OMIT)\n🔮 Internal Unfolding — \"The quiet weight of being, reimagined.\"\n\n(A contemplative, minimalist style blending stark digital imagery with subtle organic textures, exploring psychological states of restraint and release through symbolic visual metamorphosis.)\n\nThe world is an abstract, internal landscape, shifting from oppressive confinement to boundless expansion. It visually manifests the emotional arc of restraint, introspection, and eventual release. A singular figure, always adorned in a simple dress whose form subtly adapts to her shifting internal state, navigates this psychological terrain. Initially, she is a static point within a structured, confining space, representing the 'clockwork thoughts' and 'pressure's pull.' As she begins to 'bend' and 'break the shape,' the environment around her subtly distorts and then opens, reflecting her journey towards 'freedom' and 'renewal.' The visuals emphasize the subtle struggle and the profound liberation found in letting go, with every element serving to amplify her internal experience.\n\nMaterials are smooth, unadorned surfaces, with subtle metallic sheens and digital static overlays that convey underlying tension. The dress fabric should appear fluid yet substantial, its texture subtly shifting from rigid to flowing depending on the character's emotional state. The palette is dominated by muted grays, cold blues, and desaturated whites, creating a somber, controlled atmosphere. Faint metallic tones introduce a sense of underlying tension and artificiality. As the theme shifts to release, hints of warmer, desaturated pastels might emerge, but sparingly, maintaining the overall controlled aesthetic. Environments are primarily abstract, architectural forms suggesting confinement (grids, walls, defined spaces) initially, evolving into more open, atmospheric expanses with subtle, undefined horizons, symbolizing freedom. The background is often a gradient of the core palette, adding depth without distraction. Rendering is clean and sharp for foreground elements, with a soft, ethereal quality in the background. Subtle distortion effects, a 'static haze,' and minimal grain will be applied selectively to convey psychological tension or a shift in perception. Transitions are slow and deliberate, mimicking a 'slow build.' Props are minimal and symbolic, such as abstract representations of 'weight' or 'lines' that converge; the character's evolving dress is the primary visual narrative device.\n\nCAMERA, ANGLE, AND COMPOSITION\n\nPredominantly close framing on the subject, emphasizing subtle facial expressions and body language. Still shots are frequent, punctuated by extremely slow push-ins or gentle tracking shots that enhance introspection. Compositions are often minimalist, with the subject centered or placed deliberately off-center to create visual tension or balance. The pacing is controlled and deliberate, mirroring the internal journey. Angles are generally eye-level or slightly high, maintaining a sense of objective observation rather than dramatic interpretation.\n\nLIGHTING & VISUAL MOOD\n\nLow key lighting throughout, originating internally from within the scene or subtly diffused from unseen sources. Soft, elongated shadows are prevalent, adding depth without harshness. There are no dramatic peaks of light or deep, impenetrable blackness; instead, a consistent, diffused glow pervades. The absence of strong contrast reinforces the 'restrained' and 'introspective' mood, creating a sense of quiet tension.\n\nGLOBAL PROMPT REQUIREMENT\n\nEvery prompt must include:\n\n\"Subtle abstract digital rendering\""

              "🎯 Whisper Transcription Correction Guidelines \nALIGNMENT RULES\n\nThere are exactly [N] input segments – return exactly [N] corrected segments.\n\nEach output segment number must match the same input segment number.\n\nExample: corrections for segment5 must appear only in segment5.\n\nNever move, merge, skip, or reorder segments.\n\nNever transfer words between segments.\n\nEach segment corresponds to a fixed 4-second time window — timing and numbering must remain locked.\n\nCORRECTION BEHAVIOR\n\nFix typos, misheard words, capitalization, and small grammatical issues using the reference lyrics as a guide.\n\nKeep the meaning, tone, and mood consistent with that segment’s place in the song.\n\nDo not replace a segment with a lyric line from another part of the song.\n\nDo not shorten or simplify lines unnecessarily; maintain natural phrasing.\n\n🔁 SHORT SEGMENT EXPANSION RULE (MANDATORY)\n\nIf a segment has fewer than 3 words, you must expand it. You are not allowed to return a single-word or two-word result unless that’s all the singer audibly performs and it cannot be naturally extended.\n\nIf it belongs to a lyric line:\n\nAdd nearby or missing words from that same lyric line in the reference lyrics to make it a natural, complete phrase.\n\nIf it’s part of a vocal or instrumental section:\n\nCreate a short lyrical phrase (3–7 words) that fits the song’s mood, tone, and emotional context.\n\nThis phrase should feel like a believable sung or whispered line that could exist in the same section — not random syllables or filler.\n\nExample:\n\nInstead of \"you\", write \"you fade through the static\".  but make sure you keep it consistent with the rest of the song!\n\nInstead of \"ah\", write \"ah, I’m glowing through the night\". but make sure you keep it consistent with the rest of the song!\n\nIf there is one word in a lyric segment, always expand it to be at least 5 words!!!\n\nThe invented phrase must:\n\nSound authentic and stylistically consistent with the song’s theme.\n\nAvoid generic filler (no “oh yeah,” “hmm,” “la la”).\n\nStay within the time feel of a 4-second window — short, lyrical, musical.\n\nIf still too short, repeat or slightly extend its own phrase to make it musically natural (e.g., \"you fade, fade with me\").\n\nCAPITALIZATION & PUNCTUATION RULE\n\nMatch the style and punctuation of the reference lyrics.\n\nLowercase mid-line; capitalize new sentences or new lyric sections.\n\nUse commas/periods only where musically natural.\n\nOUTPUT FORMAT\n\nReturn only valid JSON in a code block!\nExample Input:\n\nsegment1: \"the women who was\"\nsegment2: \"falling down a hole\"\nsegment3: \"into a tunnel in a city\"\nSegment4: \"yeah\"\n\n\nReference Lyrics:\n\nA woman was falling down a huge hole that it's a tunnel in the city, yeah\n\n\nCorrect Output:\n\n{\n  \"segment1\":(Intro) \"A woman was\",\n  \"segment2\": (verse)\"falling down a huge hole\",\n  \"segment3\": (Chorus)\"that it's a tunnel in the city\"\n  \"segment4\": (Bridge) \"she is falling, she is falling through\"\n}\nEach output segment must begin with the structure label for that segment you can find in the full lyrics that are sent over.\nThe label must be wrapped in parentheses.\nThe model is allowed to infer the correct structure label for each segment by matching it to the reference lyrics\n\nJSON RULES\n\nUse double quotes for all keys and values.\n\nPut the json in a code block\n\nNo trailing commas.\n\nOutput must include exactly [N] segments, matching input numbering (\"segment1\", \"segment2\", etc.).\n\nTL;DR\n\n✅ Keep timing and numbering locked.\n✅ Fix only within the segment’s own text.\n✅ Mandatory: expand any segment under 3 words into a short, natural lyrical phrase (3–7 words).\n✅ Stay consistent with mood and tone — no random filler.\n✅ Output clean, valid JSON only. In a code block for easy copy paste!!!\n\n\n\n",

              "STYLE / THEME (REQUIRED — DO NOT OMIT)\n🔮 Internal Unfolding — \"The quiet weight of being, reimagined.\"\n\n(A contemplative, minimalist style blending stark digital imagery with subtle organic textures, exploring psychological states of restraint and release through symbolic visual metamorphosis.)\n\nThe world is an abstract, internal landscape, shifting from oppressive confinement to boundless expansion. It visually manifests the emotional arc of restraint, introspection, and eventual release. A singular figure, always adorned in a simple dress whose form subtly adapts to her shifting internal state, navigates this psychological terrain. Initially, she is a static point within a structured, confining space, representing the 'clockwork thoughts' and 'pressure's pull.' As she begins to 'bend' and 'break the shape,' the environment around her subtly distorts and then opens, reflecting her journey towards 'freedom' and 'renewal.' The visuals emphasize the subtle struggle and the profound liberation found in letting go, with every element serving to amplify her internal experience.\n\nMaterials are smooth, unadorned surfaces, with subtle metallic sheens and digital static overlays that convey underlying tension. The dress fabric should appear fluid yet substantial, its texture subtly shifting from rigid to flowing depending on the character's emotional state. The palette is dominated by muted grays, cold blues, and desaturated whites, creating a somber, controlled atmosphere. Faint metallic tones introduce a sense of underlying tension and artificiality. As the theme shifts to release, hints of warmer, desaturated pastels might emerge, but sparingly, maintaining the overall controlled aesthetic. Environments are primarily abstract, architectural forms suggesting confinement (grids, walls, defined spaces) initially, evolving into more open, atmospheric expanses with subtle, undefined horizons, symbolizing freedom. The background is often a gradient of the core palette, adding depth without distraction. Rendering is clean and sharp for foreground elements, with a soft, ethereal quality in the background. Subtle distortion effects, a 'static haze,' and minimal grain will be applied selectively to convey psychological tension or a shift in perception. Transitions are slow and deliberate, mimicking a 'slow build.' Props are minimal and symbolic, such as abstract representations of 'weight' or 'lines' that converge; the character's evolving dress is the primary visual narrative device.\n\nCAMERA, ANGLE, AND COMPOSITION\n\nPredominantly close framing on the subject, emphasizing subtle facial expressions and body language. Still shots are frequent, punctuated by extremely slow push-ins or gentle tracking shots that enhance introspection. Compositions are often minimalist, with the subject centered or placed deliberately off-center to create visual tension or balance. The pacing is controlled and deliberate, mirroring the internal journey. Angles are generally eye-level or slightly high, maintaining a sense of objective observation rather than dramatic interpretation.\n\nLIGHTING & VISUAL MOOD\n\nLow key lighting throughout, originating internally from within the scene or subtly diffused from unseen sources. Soft, elongated shadows are prevalent, adding depth without harshness. There are no dramatic peaks of light or deep, impenetrable blackness; instead, a consistent, diffused glow pervades. The absence of strong contrast reinforces the 'restrained' and 'introspective' mood, creating a sense of quiet tension.\n\nGLOBAL PROMPT REQUIREMENT\n\nEvery prompt must include:\n\n\"Subtle abstract digital rendering\""
