# 🎮 VRGameDevGirl’s Video / Image & HUMO Workflow Nodes for ComfyUI

Custom ComfyUI nodes for **music video workflows** and **high-quality video/image enhancement**.  
Includes HUMO-based multi-scene workflows, audio splitting, video combining, and realtime-ready enhancement tools.

---

## 🌟 New HUMO Workflow Nodes

- 🎧 **VRGDG_LoadAudioSplit_HUMO**  
  Splits an audio file (lyrics-only recommended) into per-scene snippets.  
  - Outputs `meta` (scene durations, timings, total duration).  
  - Provides per-scene audio chunks for previews. Defaulted at 3 seconds to work with Humo.
  - Lets you listen to snippets and refine prompts in sync with the music.

- 🎼 **VRGDG_LoadAudioSplitDynamic**  
  Flexible audio splitting node.  
  - Supports **custom durations** for each scene.  
  - Can optionally pad with silence for InfiniteTalk workflows that allow for longer generations. 
  - Ideal if you want more control over per-scene lengths.

- 🎬 **VRGDG_CombinevideosV2**  
  Combines multiple scene videos into one continuous video.  
  - Syncs video lengths to audio `meta` automatically.  
  - Pads short clips with last frame if needed.  
  - Requires at least **two video inputs**.  
  - Designed to keep audio and video aligned without manual duration entry.

## 🌟 Features

- 🎞️ **Fast Film Grain** (`FastFilmGrain`)  
  Add controllable, grayscale or color grain for cinematic texture.

- 🎨 **Color Match to Reference** (`ColorMatchToReference`)  
  Align image tones to a reference image using LAB color matching.

- 🎯 **Fast Unsharp Sharpen** (`FastUnsharpSharpen`)  
  Simple and efficient sharpening using unsharp masking.

- 🌀 **Fast Laplacian Sharpen** (`FastLaplacianSharpen`)  
  Edge-based sharpening via Laplacian kernel for crisp detail.

- 📏 **Fast Sobel Sharpen** (`FastSobelSharpen`)  
  Gradient-based edge enhancement using Sobel filters.

- ⚡ Optimized for **image or video workflows** and **per-frame processing** in ComfyUI.

- 💻 Designed to be efficient on modern GPUs.

## 📦 Installation

### 🧰 Using ComfyUI Manager (recommended)
1. Open ComfyUI.
2. Go to the **Manager** tab → **Install Custom Nodes**.
3. Search: `vrgamedev` or use this Git URL:  
   ```
   https://github.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl
   ```

### 🖐️ Manual Install
1. Clone or download this repo to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory.
2. Restart ComfyUI.

---

## ✨ Requirements

A `requirements.txt` file is now needed.

To install the required packages, run this from inside the `python_embeded` folder:

```
python.exe -m pip install -r ..\custom_nodes\comfyui-vrgamedevgirl\requirements.txt

```

`requirements.txt` (in the repo) includes:

```

kornia

librosa

imageio

```

## 🧠 Node Details

### ✅ Fast Film Grain (`FastFilmGrain`)
Adds customizable film grain to each frame.  
Grain can be grayscale or saturated RGB, and sized to match your output resolution.

**Inputs:**
- `images`: Frame tensor input.
- `grain_intensity`: Blend amount (0 to 1).
- `saturation_mix`: 0 = grayscale grain, 1 = full RGB noise.

🟢 *Video-safe and very fast.*

---

### 🎨 Color Match to Reference (`ColorMatchToReference`)
Matches image color distribution to a reference image using LAB space normalization.

**Inputs:**
- `images`: Your video frames.
- `reference_image`: A single image to match tone and color against.
- `match_strength`: Blend between original and matched (0.0–1.0).

---

### 🎯 Fast Unsharp Sharpen (`FastUnsharpSharpen`)
Applies unsharp masking to enhance edges with a fast, low-cost blur pass.

**Inputs:**
- `images`: Input image tensor.
- `strength`: Sharpening amount (0.0 to 2.0)

🚀 Lightweight and ideal for subtle sharpening.

---

### 🌀 Fast Laplacian Sharpen (`FastLaplacianSharpen`)
Enhances edges by applying a Laplacian kernel to bring out high-frequency detail.

**Inputs:**
- `images`: Input image tensor.
- `strength`: Sharpening amount (0.0 to 2.0)

🧪 Gives a more "punchy" sharpen effect great for detail recovery.

---

### 📏 Fast Sobel Sharpen (`FastSobelSharpen`)
Uses Sobel filters to detect image gradients and amplify edge contrast.

**Inputs:**
- `images`: Input image tensor.
- `strength`: Sharpening amount (0.0 to 2.0)

🧠 Sharpens by boosting directional edge response — great for outlines and detail clarity.
